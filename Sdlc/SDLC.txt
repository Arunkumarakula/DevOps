Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)


It is a systematic process used by software development teams to design, develop, test, and maintain software applications. It consists of a series of stages that guide the project from the initial concept to the final release.

            The main stages of SDLC:

             * Planning

             * Defining

             * Designing

             * Building

             * Testing

             * Deployment


SDLC Models:

1. Waterfall Methodology


2. Agile Methodology


3. DevOps Methodology



Waterfall:

Requirements and gathering analysis
↳ Design (tools, mockups)
↳ Code Implementation
↳ Testing
↳ Deployment (release)
↳ Monitoring (maintenance)

Drawbacks:

1. Flexibility: Difficult to make changes once a phase is completed.


2. Long Delivery Time.


3. No Early Feedback.


4. Miscommunication with the different teams.



Agile :

In the Agile methodology, each project is broken up into several iterations.

An iteration should be of the same duration (2 to 9 weeks).

At the end of each iteration, a working product should be delivered.


(Diagram):
1st interation : Plan,design,develop
2nd Iteration : plan,design,develop
3rd Iteration : plan,design,develop

Drawbacks:

1. Time-taking (up to 2 weeks) if any changes.


2. It can focus only on software development.


3. There is no collaboration between teams.




* Limitations of Agile :

Developer’s Team: “Code is working on my server!” (Wants changes)

Operation’s Team: “There is a problem in code!” (Wants stability)


Solution: DevOps


* Development with DevOps Culture:

  1. Streamlined Deliveries.

  2. Teamwork collaboration.

  3. Continuous monitoring and feedback.


* What Exactly DevOps? :

(Diagram)
Code → Plan → Build → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor  


* What is DevOps?
DevOps is a practice that allows a single team to manage the entire application development lifecycle that is development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.

                  (Code → Production)



* What does DevOps do?

  1. Integrates developers and operations teams.

  2. Improves collaboration and productivity by:

  3. Automating infrastructure.

  4. Automating workflows.

  5. Continuously measuring application performance.



* Skills of a DevOps Engineer..!

Tools: Git(vcs), Jenkins(CI_CD), Docker(contenerisation), Kubernetes(container orchestration), Ansible(configuration management), Puppet(configuration), Grafana(monitoring), Prometheus(monitoring)..etc
