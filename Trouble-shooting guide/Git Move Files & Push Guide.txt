                            * Guide1 *(Steps to Push Files After Moving Them to a Different Folder in Git)




* If we moved a file from one folder to another folder,then while pushing to GitHub repository it show's deleted files .

  Now here we have some commands to troubleshoot:


1. git add -u (Now we have to stage the changes)

       - The -u option stages any changes to tracked files, including deletions.



2. git status (we have to check status files are in staged or unstaged)


3. git commit -m "file name" ( commit the changes)


4. git pull origin main (pull the latest changes from the remote before pushing your own changes)


5. git add "file-name" 


6. git commit -m "file-name"


7. git push origin main
