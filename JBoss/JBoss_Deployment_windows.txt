* Step 5: Deploy with using wildfly-gui

          - http://localhost:9990/console (if we open with this url it asks the "username and password")

          - Now we need to configure "user-name and password" in the "bin" folder then "add-user" windows batch file

          - while creating a user it will some questions like :

             1. What type of user do you wish to add?

             5. Re-enter password

        Note : Before going to modify above configuration we can stopn the wildfly server

            - Now start the serever using bin folder - standalone (windows batch file)

            - Check with the port(localhost:9990/console/) , it will open the login page

            - In the login page we can enter the login details witch we modified in the "add-user" file 

            - after login it will open the wildfly "Homepage"

* Now here we can deploy the application or artifact using "deployment" option which is showing in the Wildfly homepage

            - click on deployment then select an option "upload-deployment",choose a file and click on "next" and click on "finish"

            - In deployment page it show's the deployed application then we can view from their deployed application.
