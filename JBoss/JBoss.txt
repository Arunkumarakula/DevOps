                                                        * JBoss *




* What is JBoss..?

  → JBoss ia a powerful open-source java application server developed by Redhat

  → It helps in deploying and managing Java-based applications in a scalable and reliable environment.




* How to Download JBos on windows.

  → wildfly.org/downloads/

       (current version is 35.00 final)

       (widly distribution-zipfile)




* We have to port numbers in JBoss:

    → 9990 for Admin/Management   (<localhost:9990>)

    → 8080 for apllications/artifacts  ( <localhost:8080>/application-Name)



* * Folder structure of the WildFly:

   Domain
     ↓
   Modules
     ↓
   Welcome-content
     ↓
   Docs
     ↓
   Bin
     ↓
   APPclient



* To start the JBoss WildFly:
  
    → Go to the home folder of the WildFly, then go to 'bin'.
   
    → Click on the file 'standalone' (Windows Batch file).



* How to shutdown the JBoss WildFly:

    → One way is to close the black window where the 'standalone' is running.



* How to create Management Console user creation:

   → <home folder of WildFly> > cd bin

   → File name: add-user (Windows batch file)
   
   → Once you double-click on 'add-user', it will ask you the following questions:

   What type of user do you wish to add?

     ① Management user (mgmt-users.properties)
    
     ② Application user (application-users.properties)

   → By clicking any option, it will show how to create a user with a new login credential.



* How to access the WildFly:

  → Admin management console: <URL: 9990>

  → Give username & password to login and to launch the WildFly web server.




→ One of the folder structures is standalone, where we will be having the configuration, deployment, and logs.

        * Standalone → Configuration, Deployment, Logs



→ Configuration: Where we will be having configurations of applications, users, and specifics.

        Example: mgmt-users.properties & mgmt-groups.properties



→ Logs: standalone > log → Logs of the WildFly



→ Deployment: A deployment represents anything that can be deployed.

       Example: An application such as EJB, JAR, WAR, EAR, or any kind of standard archive such as RAR or JBoss-specific deployment into a server.



→ You can use drag and drop to add new content or replace existing deployments.

   Simply drag one or several files onto the deployment column. If there is already a deployment with the same name, the deployment will be replaced; otherwise, the deployment will be added.


→ The deployments added by drag and drop will be enabled by default.



* In left pane page , these will be three options under deployments :

      1.upload Deployment

      2.Un-managed Deployment

      3.create empty Deployment



* How to deploy the application (or) artifacts :

   one way:

  1. copying the war file and pastig it deployment folder of wildfly (Home of wildfly → standlone → Deployments)



* Anotherway :

  2. cp <artifact source path> <destination of deployments of wildfly>



* Anotherway :

  3. JBoss wildfly gui → upload Artifact





* How can we change default port numbers of wildfly..?
 
   → Open wildfly folder then open "standalone"  and then "configuration" folder then change a ports in standalone.xml and standalone-full.xml(files) in the "socket-binding"

       Eg : wildfly folder  → Standalone(folder) → configuration(folder) → standalone.xml (or) standalone-full.xml(files)



* How to shutdown the JBoss wildfly..?

  → wildfly folder → bin(folder) → JBoss-cli(windows batch file)
